# Cabin

## Note: I'm using supabase for the back-end and it deactivate the back-end if there are not actions or request in 7 days so most of the time when you try to use the project it's deactivated and it won't log you in, if you want to try it gimme a message on twitter 

 
## Note: does not support small size screens yet

## What is it ?

It works like `reservation system management` supports a lot of the featuers that available out in the world 

## Setup

### install dependencies

    $ npm install

### Runing the project

    $ npm run start

### It worths the visit :)
